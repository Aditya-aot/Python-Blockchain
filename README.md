üß¨ Technical Deep Dive: Python-Blockchain Project üîç

My blockchain exploration project leverages several key blockchain technologies:

üîπ Technologies Used:
- Python as the core programming language
- Web3.py for Ethereum blockchain interactions
- Infura as the provider for mainnet connections
- Ganache for local blockchain testing
- Smart contracts via ABI interfaces

üîπ Key Implementations:
1. Establishing Web3 connections to both public and local networks
2. Reading blockchain state (balances, block numbers, etc.)
3. Interacting with deployed token contracts (ERC-20)
4. Signing and sending transactions on test networks
5. Reading and writing to smart contracts
